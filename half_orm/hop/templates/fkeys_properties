To use the foreign keys as direct attributes of the relation class,
copy/paste the FKEYS/FKEYS_PROPERTIES bellow in your code and replace the
empty string(s) with the alias you want to use.
The aliases must be unique and different from any of the column names. Empty
strings are ignored. FKEYS_PROPERTIES is deprecated.

FKEYS = [
    {}
]
