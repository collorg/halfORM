# halfORM Extensions

halfORM 0.16 introduces a powerful extension system that automatically discovers and integrates additional functionality through the unified `half_orm` CLI.

## How Extensions Work

Extensions are Python packages that follow the `half-orm-*` naming convention and provide CLI integration through a simple discovery mechanism.

### Installation & Discovery

```bash
# Install any halfORM extension
pip install half-orm-extension-name

# Extensions are automatically discovered
half_orm --list-extensions

# Use extension commands immediately
half_orm extension-name command
```

### Extension Architecture

Extensions integrate seamlessly with the halfORM CLI by providing:

- **Auto-discovery**: Packages matching `half-orm-*` pattern
- **CLI integration**: Commands added to the main `half_orm` interface
- **Metadata**: Version, description, and available commands
- **Isolation**: Each extension operates independently

## Official Extensions

Official extensions are maintained by the halfORM team and follow strict quality and compatibility standards.

## Community Extensions

We welcome community-contributed extensions! Here's how to get started:

### Creating an Extension

1. **Name your package** following the `half-orm-*` convention
2. **Implement discovery** by creating a `cli_extension.py` module
3. **Add CLI commands** using Click framework
4. **Publish to PyPI** for easy installation

### Extension Template

```python
# your_extension/cli_extension.py
import click

def add_commands(main_cli):
    """Required entry point for halfORM extensions."""
    
    @main_cli.group()
    def your_extension():
        """Your extension commands."""
        pass
    
    @your_extension.command()
    def hello():
        """Say hello."""
        click.echo("Hello from your extension!")
```

For a complete working example, see [half-orm-test-extension](https://github.com/collorg/half-orm-test-extension) which demonstrates all the essential patterns for extension development.

### Guidelines for Community Extensions

- **Naming**: Use `half-orm-*` format (e.g., `half-orm-my-feature`)
- **Documentation**: Include clear README with usage examples
- **Testing**: Provide test suite for your extension
- **Compatibility**: Test with multiple halfORM versions
- **Security**: Follow security best practices
- **Licensing**: Use compatible open-source license

### Submitting Extensions

Community extensions can be:

1. **Listed here** by submitting a PR to this documentation
2. **Promoted to official** if they meet quality standards and fill important use cases
3. **Featured** in halfORM blog posts and tutorials

## Extension Development

### Local Development Setup

```bash
# Clone extension template
git clone https://github.com/collorg/half-orm-extension-template
cd half-orm-extension-template

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Test extension discovery
half_orm --list-extensions
```

### Testing Extensions

```bash
# Test your extension
half_orm your-extension --help

# Run extension tests
pytest tests/

# Test with multiple halfORM versions
tox
```
